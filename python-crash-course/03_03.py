# Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a
# motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your
# list to print a series of statements about these items, such as "I would like
# to own a Honda motorcycle."

cars = ['Versa', 'Jeep', 'Rav4', 'Tacoma', '4Runner']

print(f"After moving to New Mexico, I sold my {cars[0]}.")
print(f'Eventually, we traded in the {cars[2]} and got a {cars[3]} and {cars[4]}.')
