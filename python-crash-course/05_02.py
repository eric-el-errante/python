# More Conditional Tests: You don't have to limit the number of tests
# you create to ten. If youw ant to try more comparisons, write more
# tests and add them to conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True 
# and one False result for each of the following:

# Tests for equality and inequality with strings
name_0 = 'Alexis'
name_1 = 'Eric'
print("name_0 = 'Alexis', name_02 = 'Eric'")
print("name_0 == 'Alexis'", name_0 == 'Alexis')
print("name_1 == 'eric'", name_1 == 'eric')
print("name_0 != 'Ryker'", name_1 != 'Ryker')
print("name_1 != 'Eric'", name_1 != 'Eric')

# Tests using the lower() method
print("name_0.lower() == 'alexis'", name_0.lower() == 'alexis')
print("name_1.lower() != 'eric'", name_1.lower() != 'eric')

# Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and
# less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
