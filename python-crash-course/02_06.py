# a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and represent it
# with a new variable called message. Print your message.

famous_person = 'Richard P. Feynman'
message = 'Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it does not matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.'
