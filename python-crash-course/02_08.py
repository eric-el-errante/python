# Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
# operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your
# operations in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines
# that look like this:
#   print(5+3)
# Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on
# each line.

print(7+1)
print(17-9)
print(2*4)
print(32/4) # this will produce 8.0 instead of 8
print(2**3) # added in the exponent for practice
